<h3>YOU KNOW I WONDER WHAT DO I LOVE ABOUT YOU &#x1FAC2; &#x2764;</h3>
<p style="color:yellow;">When that comes to my mind,I always answer my self by saying thats the most dumb question i would ask myself.<br>Because i almost Love every thing about you ,maybe the red cheeks the most or maybe the smile .<br>HAHAHA i will be lying if i could single out something i like the most about you.<br>Just wanted to tell you that your so important to me,HAHA that sounds kinda formal I just could'nt think of another way.<br>We had our on share of argumants ,break ups,maybe even awkward moments and yet were still togather (^0^).<br>Those obstacles are also a part of our important memory.<br>Its really nice to look back and see how far we've gone .I had so much fun last year.I was just sad I couldnt enjoy New year and Christmas with you.<br>I was angry that time literally (^_^).</p>
<p style="color:Pink;*/text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #FFC0CB */ glowing pink shadow */ font-size: 4em"><b>Loving you and being Loved by you</b></p>
<p> has been a blessing to me and will continue to being one.I can'nt have enough of it ,that will be actually dumb really dumb &#x1FAE4;.<br>I was joking about those rough times being important,i hated that so much &#x1F60C; .<br>But its really a great feeling knowing we've passed through that while being in a disadvantage of being far away.<br>We worked things out and managed to trust each other .</p>
<h4 style="font-size:40px;">I am really happy we made it this far &#128513;</h4>
<h5 style="color:#FF69B4;"><strong>I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU</strong></h5>
<p>Am just hoping our dreams and goals might align or at least give us a opportunity to be togather</p>
<h6>JUST A SPECIAL TOUCH,TO SPICE IT UP.HAHA just hope it works and tell me what you think of it.<h6>
<P style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:20px;"> Though miles apart, our hearts still beat,<br>
 In moments of silence, I hear your sweet,<br>
 Voice calling me, a distant song,<br>
 A melody of love that still feels strong.<br><br>
 We’
 ve faced the storms, we've shed the tears,<br>
 Fought through the doubts, battled the fears,<br>
 The distance stretched, but love remained,<br>
 Though broken, we healed, and we regained.<br><br>
 There were times I questioned if we'd survive,<br>
 But every struggle helped us thrive.<br>
 The pain was real, the moments cold,<br>
 But we emerged with hearts of gold.<br><br>
 Now, I long for your touch, so true,<br>
 The warmth of your skin, the feel of you,<br>
 To hold you close, never to part,<br>
 To feel the rhythm of your heart.<br><br>
 I dream of the day I’
 ll see your face,<br>
 The sparkle in your eyes, the beauty, the grace,<br>
 When our worlds collide, and we're no longer apart,<br>
 When I can finally feel you, heart to heart.<br><br></p>
